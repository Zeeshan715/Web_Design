# Rest-Countries-Listing-App
This project revolves around a Flag Listing application. The application fetches data from an API to display information about various countries. Notably, it incorporates several filters to enhance usability, including a search filter that enables users to search for specific countries. Additionally, a region filter allows users to filter the list and view countries based on their respective regions.
Moreover, the application offers a delightful feature: the ability to toggle between light and dark modes. This allows users to customize their viewing experience according to their preferences.
